## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS / SCSS
- 7 to 1 theme
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a lot in relation to develop a front-end design from a preview. Practiced a lot of CSS and SCSS styles in order to match up the proposed.

New properties that I learned:

```scss
line-height: 2rem; // Adjust the line height in a paragraph
vertical-align: super; // Text superscript
```

### Continued development

Next I'd like to complete it faster, I spent 1 whole week to do it, but I'm proud of the result.
